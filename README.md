# About our book
[Learning Swift: build an iOS game](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781939902115.do) 
This book is intended for beginners to intermediate developers who might already know a programming language like Javascript, Objective-C or Ruby and are interested in learning how to build a game in Apple's new programming lanaguage called Swift. 
In this book we dive into the core of Swift and show readers how expressive and fun the Swift language is. Along the way you will learn how to create a 2D casual Pencil Adventure game that will help you learn the aspects of the Swift language. By the end, you will not only be comfortable with the Swift programming language, but you will be familiar working with Cocoa API's, having the tools and understanding necessary to tackle applications of any nature or size.

# Build Environment
